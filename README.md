# GroupMaker

Bare minimum (Minimum Viable Product):
- 6 people
- one “include” and one “exclude” option for each
- creates 2 groups based on their preferences
- displays the groups on the page

Later features:
- multiple “include” choices and multiple “exclude” choices
- choose the number of groups or choose the ideal number of people in a group
- scalable to a larger number of people
- reshuffle option after groups are created to create new groupings based on the same preferences
- CSV import for list of names
- if it’s not possible to make groups using the given choices, give the user a warning and create groups excluding those people and allow the user to add them manually
